# Technical Test
## Controls:
- Movement: WASD or arrow keys<br>
- Jump: Space<br>
- Jetpack: Left shift (only available when you are not grounded)

## Objective:<br>
The goal of the game is to reach the green button above the platform by using the main mechanics of the game, which involve finding a key in order to remove the door that leads to the goal.

## Assets included in the development of the game:<br>
- TextMesh Pro<br>
- Postprocessing<br>
- Gridbox Prototype Materials

## What should we look for in your project?
Things to keep in mind about the development:<br>
- Postprocessing.
- Cinemachine.
- Out of map prevention system.
- Aesthetics of materials and environment.
- Good hierarchy organization.
## What are you most proud of?
The third person functionality, using the relative position of the camera to affect the direction of the player. this added to the feeling of the jetpack.
## What could have been done better?
There are always things to improve, a lot of things could have been made as for example, a timer, a trail for the sphere, a particle system for the jetpack, better models for the stage and for the key, a better fall prevention system on the map and so on.
## How much time was spent on each section/ task.
Total development time was around 5 hours.
