# Technical Test
### Unity Version:
2021.3.16f1 LTS
### Controls:
- Movement: WASD or arrow keys<br>
- Jump: Space<br>
- Jetpack: Left shift (only available when you are not grounded)
### Objective:<br>
The goal of the game is to reach the green button above the platform by using the main mechanics of the game, which involve finding a key in order to remove the door that leads to the goal.
### Assets included in the development of the game:<br>
- TextMesh Pro<br>
- Postprocessing<br>
- Gridbox Prototype Materials
### What should we look for in your project?
Things to keep in mind about the development:<br>
- Postprocessing.
- Cinemachine.
- Out of map prevention system.
- Aesthetics of materials and environment.
- Good hierarchy organization.
- Scalable UI with fuel feedback.
### What are you most proud of?
It is a fairly simple project, but the mechanics turned out with a good feeling, mostly the jetpack behaviour. An interesting prototype look was achieved and also the third person functionality, using the relative position of the camera to affect the direction of the player was a good decision to make.
### What could have been done better?
There are always things to improve, a lot of things could have been developed as for example, a timer, a trail for the sphere, a particle system for the jetpack, better models for the stage and for the key, a better fall prevention system on the map and so on.
### How much time was spent on each section/ task.
Total development time was around 6 hours.
